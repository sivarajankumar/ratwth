FAQ:


I can see my L2P Rooms, what do I do now?

The left most button will open the RSS feed specific for this learning room with all the changes made to this learning room recently. You have full access to all the announcements, discussions and wiki-pages of this learning room.
The button in the middle will open the Campus-page of the lecture that is connected with the L2P room in a webbrowser.

The button on the right takes you to the L2P room.
Here selecting "Materials" will take you to all the downloadable documents in this L2P room. Selecting any other will take you to that specific section of the L2P room in a webbrowser.

There are no entries in my Calendar:

Make sure that you have added some events into your Campus Calendar via the Campus Office Website. The App will export your Calendar as a .vcf and use this as the Basis.
Also make sure that you are up to date with the Calendar, by going to the Menu and selecting "Redownload Calendar". The App will not do this each time, but use a local copy of the vcf file.

Checking my Username/Password fails:

Please make sure that you are connected to the internet and can access the L2P and Campus website and that both Passwords are entered corretly.

The RSS feed does not show any entries:

Check the Timeframe you configured in the configuration Menu and make sure that there actually have been updates in any of your L2P rooms during that time period.
